And \w+ is no exception
Pundits say
Critics say
critics are quick to point out
The American people
The narrative
Probe
(Opens|offers) a rare window
Begs the question
Be that as it may
If you will
A cautionary tale
Cautiously optimistic
Needless to say
Suffice it to say
This is not your father’s \w+

At a crossroads
powers that be
Outside the box
A favorite Washington parlor game
Don’t get me wrong
Make no mistake
Yes, Virginia, there is a \w+
Christmas came early for
Chock full
Last-ditch effort
Cue the \w+
Call it \w+
Pity the poor \w+
It’s the \w+, stupid
^Imagine
Time will tell
What a difference \w+ makes
Palpable sense of relief
Sigh of relief
Plenty of blame to go around
Rorschach test
An object lesson
Turned a blind eye
Underscores
Cycle of violence
Searing indictment
Potent symbol
Broken system
\w+ system is broken
Famously

What happens in \w+ stays in \w+
Oft-cited
Little-noticed
Closely watched
Hastily convened
Much ballyhooed
ill-advised
Shrouded in secrecy
Since time immemorial
Tipping point
Inflection point
Point of no return
The [anything] community
If history is any guide
If past is prologue
devil is in the details
\w+ does not suffer fools gladly
A ragtag army
ragtag militia
A tale of two \w+
Ignominious end
Tightly knit
In the final analysis
At the end of the day
For all intents and purposes
Cooler heads prevailed
Victim of (his|her) own success

Well-heeled lobbyists
Skittish donors
Byzantine rules
Strange bedfellows
A mass of contradictions
A land of contradictions
Rise of the 24-hour news cycle
In the digital age
Not so fast
Not so much
Remains to be seen
Tenuous at best
Woefully inadequate
Or so it seems
Depending on whom you ask
Burst onto the national political scene
For now
Tectonic shifts
seismic shifts
Optics
Feeding frenzy
feeding the frenzy
Double down
Game-changer
In the wake of
How I learned to stop worrying and love \w+
Love \w+ or hate \w+
The \w+ we love to hate

A portrait emerges
In a nutshell
The social fabric
the very fabric of our
Hot-button issue
Hotly contested
Perfect storm
Face-saving compromise
Eye-popping
The argument goes
The thinking goes
Contrary to popular belief
Intoned
The new normal
The new face of
The talk of the town
It couple
power couple
Paradigm shift
Unlikely revolutionary
Unlikely reformer
Grizzled veteran
Manicured lawns
Wide-ranging interview
Rose from obscurity
Dizzying array
Withering criticism
Predawn raid
Nondescript office building
Unsung hero
Sparked debate
Raised questions
Raises more questions than answers
Raise the specter of

But (reality|truth) is more complicated
Scarred by war
War-torn
War of words
Trading barbs

Not as much as you think
You guessed it
Shifting dynamics

Partisans on both sides
Charm offensive
Fallen on hard times
On thin ice
A crisis waiting to happen

Creature of Washington
Official Washington
A modest proposal
Stinging rebuke
Mr. \w+ goes to Washington

Fevered speculation
Hope filled the air

How did we get here
But first, some background
Growing body of evidence

Resists easy (classification|categorization)
Increasingly
Tapped
